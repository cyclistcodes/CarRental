# Car Rental bootstrap project

This minimal bootstrap project contains a React UI and a backend powered by Spring, connected to a PostgreSQL database.
Before you start the project make sure you have Maven, Java 17, Docker ( for easy setup of database ), Node 16 LTS and NPM installed. 

You will be able to see the text "Hello world!" in the UI if you successfully manage to start the backend, frontend and the database. You are not supposed to use the "hello world" code, its only purpose is to verify that you have everything up and running correctly. 

## How to start the project

#### 1. Set up the database
You may start a database with the following docker command based on the [Bitnami PostgreSQL Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/postgresql/):

`docker run --name postgresql -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRESQL_USERNAME=my_user -e POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=password123 -e POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=rental bitnami/postgresql:latest`


#### 2. Start the backend 
The backend was bootstrapped with [Spring initializr](https://start.spring.io/) and is configured to run against a PostgreSQL database.

Start the backend by running  `com.example.rental.RentalApplication#main`.


#### 3. Start the frontend
The frontend was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

See `package.json` for npm commands. The `package.json` has a proxy for the backend hosted at `http://localhost:8080`.

Start the frontend by doing `npm install` followed by `npm start` in the `frontend` folder
